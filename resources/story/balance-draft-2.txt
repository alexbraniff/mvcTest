(thoughts of Balance (=); rough translation)

<he can feel some sort of itching inside of himself>

<he thinks of the feeling and imagines that he is looking at it>

<his thoughts cloud and lose focus>

<time passes>

<fairly rapidly his thoughts come back into focus>

=oh my! I can see?

<he could see, sort of; his daughter, not fully materialised, was suspended in time before him>

<as he continued to inhale, small indescript particles formed and moved to gather in a large cloud of particles>

<he stopped breathing (very very) shortly into the breath and his daughter's formation stopped with it>

<he exhaled slightly and the particles began to scatter and disappear>

=huh..

=I control time and space..

=within myself..

<he inhales to the point that his daughter's formation has seemingly finished>

<nothing more happens, no matter how much he inhales or exhales>

=hmm..

"You can speak," he says.

"Father," say the particles. "What is this?"
