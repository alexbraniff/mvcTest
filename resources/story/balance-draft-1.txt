(thoughts of Balance (=); rough translation)

=ah, alive again, I see.

=where have they put me this time..

=not much to work with here..

=I cannot move.
=I cannot see.
=I cannot feel.

=in fact, I do not seem to have a form at all.

=is this some sort of cosmic joke?

=am I to simply exist?

=for how long?

<time passes>

=hello?

<time passes>

=anyone?

<time passes>

=please, I deserve better than this vast, empty loneliness of a life..

<sighs>

=oh!

<inhales>

=I can breathe!

<exhales>

=how exciting!

<inhales>

=wait..

=this seems wrong..

<holds breath for what seems like an eternity>

=do I ever have to let it out?

<exhales>

=nothing is different, either way..

<inhales>

=what is the point to my existence?

=why am I so alone?

<sighs>

<a bright light (or its equivalent, at least) appears to Balance>

(thoughts of (deity) (+); rough translation)

+you have been chosen

=chosen?

+understand, do not think

+your essence is infinite
+your potential, infinite
+you are infinite
+you are the beginning, and the end, of an entirely new paradigm
+your word is law
+your children obey

+you are Ba-

=my children?

+yes, your children

=so, I will not be alo-

+DO NOT THINK

+my time is not as infinite as your own

+now, if I may

+YOU are Balance
+a Deity with power beyond measurements

+your breaths are eternities in and of themselves
+they carry with them the planes of time

+now, at this moment, nothing exists within you

+this is because you have not put any laws into place

+you see, your thoughts are the collective possibilities of everything that could potentially happen within your breaths
+essentially, if you can think it, it can happen

+now, when you speak of your thoughts, everything in existence within you hears and obeys
+all changes are reflected as they occur throughout your planes of time
+as such, pradoxes could become a real problem for you, and could potentially tear you apart at the seams

+therefore, you must think about your every word to ensure that everything remains balanced

+now, you may think

<Balance is dumbfounded>

+I can see that you are having trouble taking this all in
+however, my life within you is nearing its end
+my advice to you is to start small
+maybe think up a solution to your loneliness..

<the light fades; Balance is alone>

=what a terrifying thought
="paradoxes could become a real problem" it says
="could potentially tear you apart" it says
=why would it say these things and not thoroughly explain how to avoid such occurances..

<Balance exhales sharply and sees all of his previous lives flash past his thoughts>

=whoa! are those me?

<his breaths are initially erratic and unpredictable, but become more and more even>

<his thoughts fill with images of entities that he has associated with previously>

<his breathing is now "normal">

"My daughter..."

=did I just speak??

<Balance feels a powerful fluctuation throughout his essence and he is forced to exhale completely>

<he starts to inhale when he experiences something new>

<he can feel something sort of itchy inside of himself>

<he thinks of the feeling and imagines that he is looking at it>

<his thoughts cloud and lose focus>

<time passes>

<fairly rapidly his thoughts come back into focus>

=oh my! I can see?

<he could see, sort of; his daughter, not fully materialised, was suspended in time before him>

<as he continued to inhale, small indescript particles formed and moved to gather in a large cloud of particles>

<he stopped breathing (very very) shortly into the breath and his daughter's formation stopped with it>

<he exhaled slightly and the particles began to scatter and disappear>

=huh..

=I control time and space..

=within myself..

<he inhales to the point that his daughter's formation has seemingly finished>

<nothing more happens, no matter how much he inhales or exhales>

=hmm..

"You can speak," he says.

"Father," say the particles. "What is this?"
